Accuracy Checker for Deep Speech
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a sample for enable the accuracy checker to execute the Deep Speech.

Prepare the dataset libriSpeech
-----------------------
Suggest using this [script](https://github.com/SeanNaren/deepspeech.pytorch/blob/master/data/librispeech.py) which from this [repo](https://github.com/SeanNaren/deepspeech.pytorch) download the dataset and convert the `.flac` into `.wav` with 16kHz. Or download the dataset from [Librispeech](http://www.openslr.org/12) and convert the `.flac` into `.wav` with 16kHz by yourself.
