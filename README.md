# DeepSpeech OpenVINO

* **Update**: Currently, you can find the sample at [OMZ](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/open_model_zoo) which support Deep Speech `0.6.1` and `0.8.2`, please find [Speech Recognition Demo](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/open_model_zoo/blob/master/demos/python_demos/speech_recognition_demo/README.md) for detail. 

This is the demo application which based on OpenVINO™ for Deep Speech algorithm, which make speech to text that are being performed on input speech audio. In this repository, not only provide an inference pipeline, but also provide an model downloader and accuracy checker for deep speech. Users can use accuracy checker to check the performance and use model downloader to download the deep speech model automatically. For more information, refer to the corresponding pages:
